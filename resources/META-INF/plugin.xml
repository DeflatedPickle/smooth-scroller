    <description><![CDATA[
    IntelliJ plugin that provides smooth scrolling. It also provides acceleration effects
    with easing so you can "fling" like on a cell phone. I have tested it with touchpads and mouse wheels on IntelliJ Community
    and Android Studio. Hopefully, it will work on any IntelliJ product.<br />
    <br />
    There are several options available under Tools -> Smooth Scroller Options...<br />

    Between these and the touchpad/mouse settings on your hardware, you should be able to get good performance.<br />
