    <description><![CDATA[
    This plugin provides smooth and inertial scrolling to all text editors. It provides acceleration effects
    with easing so you can "fling" like on a cell phone. <br />
    <br />
    There are several tuning options available under Tools -> Smooth Scroller Options...<br />
    Between these and the touchpad or mouse settings on your hardware, you should be able to get the effect you desire.
